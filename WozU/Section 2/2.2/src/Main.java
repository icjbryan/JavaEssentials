		//Equality-Begin by looking at the equality operation. If two values are equal to each other, 
		//then they are the same. 
		//This simple idea can be modeled in Java using two equal sign symbols (==) 
		
		//int a = 5;
		//int b = 5;
		//true
		
		int a = 5;
		int b = 6;
		boolean result = (a == b);
		System.out.println(result);
		//false
		
		//= is Assignment. Use this to Assign values in variables. A helpful mnemonic: 
		//One equal sign is used when One value it set inside One variable.
		//== is Equality. Use this to determine if the two arguments are Equal. 
		//A helpful mnemonic: Two equal signs take Two values Two (to) compare equality.
